# EMB TV

A non-profit personal project that showcase a web app to watch TV channels and guide (EPG).

## Demo

## Inspiration:

When visiting a web with free TV there is a lot of Ads and no User Experience. So instead of switching between pages to view a different channel, the app allow you to change channel and continue watching in the same player like a paid app would do.

This project uses: React, TypeScript, Shaka Player, Scss, among others, and is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Disclaimer:

The web is built with external resource for the streams and guide data. For that, the availability of such information is not always guarantee.
